**Accurate nevus shapes** is a dataset for instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the medical industry.

The dataset consists of 3208 images with 6667 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*nevus*).

Images in the Accurate nevus shapes dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (3208 images). The dataset was released in 2022.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 1 classes:
